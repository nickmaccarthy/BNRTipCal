Brayden, Nick and Roberts (BNR) Tip Calculator 
==================================================

My son wanted to learn how to code, he is 12 and loves technology.  He suggested a "tip calculator" since we go out to eat way to much and he is always figuring out how much we should leave as a tip.  His friend was also interested in learning how to code as well, so we collaborated together and made one (hence the BNR for Brayden, Nick and Robert).  This is our attempt.  

In this project I taught them..
* How to go through the process of designing an application
* How to design the basis of our project
  * We learned how to calculate a tip with a program we built first
* How to use source control
* The basics of Javascript and with some help from the jQuery framework
* The basics of CSS and HTML
  * We learned what CSS frameworks were and how easy they make life through the use of Twitter Bootstrap
* How to put all of these together and build something that worked
